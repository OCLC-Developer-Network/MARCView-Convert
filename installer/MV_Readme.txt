
WELCOME TO MARCView(tm)!


INSTALLATION

1. Terminate MARCView if you have it running.

2. Uninstall any earlier versions of MARCView, including
"Lite" versions:

- Releases 3.8 or later: Run Add/Remove Programs from the
Windows Control Panel and remove "Systems Planning MARCView".

- Releases 3.0 through 3.7: Run Add/Remove Programs from the
Windows Control Panel and remove "MARCView".

- Releases before 3.0: Delete the MARCView directory.

Uninstalling will NOT remove the MARCView.ini file, so your
settings will be saved.

3. Go to http://www.systemsplanning.com/download.asp

4. In the dropdown on that page, select "MARCView 3.9".

5. Enter the access code previously sent by email.

6. Click the "Download" button.

7. You may "Open" the file to install it immediately, or "Save"
it to your hard drive. If you "Save" it, run the downloaded 
program by double-clicking on it. Installation uses the
"Microsoft Installer" program.

Do not install MARCView to the same folder as MARConvert(tm).


RUNNING MARCVIEW

To run MARCView, click the Windows Start button, go to 
Programs, then the MARCView group, then MARCView. When 
MARCView starts, click the "View" button to open a file 
of MARC records.

You can also set up MARCView so you can right-click on 
any file and open it in MARCView. See 
http://www.systemsplanning.com/marc/mvhelp.asp#sendto
to see how to set up this feature.

We guarantee MARCView will read any file of true MARC21, 
USMARC, CanMARC, UNIMARC, or MARCXML records -- or we fix it 
free. MARCView also unblocks blocked records from RLIN.
