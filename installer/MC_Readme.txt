INSTALLATION

1. Terminate MARConvert if you have it running.

2. Uninstall any earlier versions of MARConvert:

  - Run Add/Remove Programs from the Windows Control Panel and 
    remove "MARConvert" or "Systems Planning MARConvert".

  - Uninstalling will NOT remove the MARCView.ini file, so your
    settings will be saved.

3. Go to http://www.systemsplanning.com/download.asp

4. In the dropdown on that page, select the MARConvert version 
developed for your organization.

5. Enter the access code previously sent by email.

6. Click the "Download" button.

7. You may "Open" the file to install it immediately, or "Save"
it to your hard drive. If you "Save" it, run the downloaded 
program by double-clicking on it. Installation uses the
"Microsoft Installer" program.

Do not install MARConvert to the same folder as MARCView(tm).
